              <p>
                Whatever I am today is because of the support I have received
                from the society and I strongly believe to give back to the
                community in whichever small way possible. With that intent, I
                will waive off 100% of the fee if you donate the equivalent
                amount to a charity of your choice for any cause that is close
                to your heart. Even donations done to individuals in need will
                count. Just let me know the details in mail.
